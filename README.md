# tdcli
A simple Ruby Command Line Interface for Todoist

Building this to learn Ruby and integrate Todoist into my operating system. Most existing implementations are in Python as well as add extra formmating that prevent me from running things like `tdcli tasks | wc -l` to get a count of my tasks.

$ tdcli tasks
